v3.10
======
qibuild
--------

* Include test dependencies in ``<build>/dependencies.cmake``
  This allows you to declare ``gtest`` as a ``testtime`` dependency only.
  (No need for it to be a ``buildtime`` dependency)

qidoc
-----

* Add support for translating ``sphinx`` doc projects. See :ref:`qidoc-tutorial`
  for details.

qipy
-----

* ``qipy bootstrap``: prettier output

qisrc
-----

* Fix using relative paths with ``qisrc init``
* ``qisrc push``: When the project is not under code review,
  warn and ask the user if he is sure before running ``git push``.
  You can use the ``-y`` option to disable this check.
* ``qisrc push`` can now only be used on one git project.
  (Previously you could run ``qisrc push --all``, but that was
  deemed to dangerous)

qitoolchain
-----------

* ``qitoolchain convert-package``: Properly raises an ``NotImplementedError``
  when used with an ``.rpm`` file

cmake
-----

* Add ``Qt5Svg``
* ``qt5-tools``: fix some bugs occurring during cross-compilation
