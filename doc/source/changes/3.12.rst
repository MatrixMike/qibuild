v3.12
======

qibuild
--------

* Add support for meta projects, that is a project that only has dependencies
  to other projects, but no source code or ``CMakeLists.txt``

  To create a ``meta`` project, use a ``meta`` attribute in the ``qiproject.xml``,
  like so:

  .. code-block:: xml

      <project version="3">
        <qibuild name="foo" meta="true">
          <depends runtime="true" names="bar baz" >
        </qibuild>
      </project>
