v3.12
======

qibuild
--------

* Add support for meta projects, that is a project that only has dependencies
  to other projects, but no source code or ``CMakeLists.txt``

  To create a ``meta`` project, use a ``meta`` attribute in the ``qiproject.xml``,
  like so:

  .. code-block:: xml

      <project version="3">
        <qibuild name="foo" meta="true">
          <depends runtime="true" names="bar baz" >
        </qibuild>
      </project>

* CMake Generator now defaults to ``Ninja`` if ``ninja`` executable is found.

* Honor ``qiproject.xml`` when looking for dependencies in the toolchain.

  Previously all packages in the toolchain were taken into account.

  You can set ``QIBUILD_LOOSE_DEPS_RESOLUTION=1`` environment variable
  to get back the old behavior

qisrc
------

* ``qisrc push``: allow specifying destination branch as first argument.

  For instance, while on ``perso`` branch, you can use ``qisrc push master`` to
  push run ``git push gerrit perso:refs/for/master``. This will push all
  the commits from ``perso`` branch that are not yet on ``master`` branch
  for review.

  You can also specify the local ref by using ":" in the first argument.

  For instance, to push everything but the last commit, you can use
  ``qisrc push HEAD~1:master``

* Fix ``qisrc info`` when there is no manifest
