v3.11.4
=======

qibuild
-------

* Add support for parallel builds. For instance, when using
  ``qibuild make -j8 -J2``, ``qibuild`` will spawn two threads, each of
  them running the build with 8 parallel jobs.

  .. note:: This feature is best used in conjunction with a distributed
            computing system such as ``incredibuild`` or ``distcc``
